# Word-Guess-Game
---------------

##  **1.	Introduction** 

          This is a Word Guess Game.  The theme for this game is Walt Disney animated movies.  All the 
          movies chosen were released between 1940 and 2013.  



##  **2.	Game Description**

          The player presses any key to get started.  The number of blanks displayed indicates the 
          number of letters in the name of the movie.  

          The player starts by guessing letters.  Each letter correctly guessed is added to the 
          corresponding blank.  The wrong guesses will also be displayed as a reminder to the player 
          that they should be avoided in future guesses.  The wrong guesses are displayed in another 
          part of the screen.  

          The player is allowed to make ten guesses per movie.  The number of remaining guesses will 
          be updated and displayed each time the player guesses incorrectly.  As the player’s correct 
          guesses increase, more letters in the name of the movie are revealed.  

          If the player runs out of guesses before she could guess the movie correctly, she scores a 
          loss.  The screen displays a smiley face with a “Try again!” message.  Conversely, if the 
          player guesses the movie correctly within the number of guesses allowed, she scores a win.  
          The screen displays an image of the movie correctly guessed.  The game tracks the player’s 
          wins and losses.  

          After the player wins or loses each round, the game resets and another random movie will be 
          generated for the player to guess.  The player can then proceed to play again.
